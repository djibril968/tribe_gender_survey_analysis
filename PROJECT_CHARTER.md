Strengthening Gender diversity and Inclusion in Tribe Tampere
Introduction
Gender diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and related activities is a global concept that transcends borders and industries, geared towards creating a more equitable and innovative entrepreneurial landscape. Despite the reported social and economic benefits of women’s entrepreneurial activity globally, entrepreneurship continues to remain a male-dominated phenomena (Hughes et al. 2012). 
Addressing existing gender disparities, biases and barriers that may hinder an all-inclusive entrepreneurial landscape is imperative for driving continuous innovation, economic growth, and social progress. By promoting gender diversity, organizations and societies can harness the full potential of diverse perspectives and talents, leading to more creative solutions, better decision-making, and a more vibrant and sustainable entrepreneurial community.
Problem
Over the years, several policies, programs, and initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity and supporting the inclusion and advancement of all genders have been put in place, yet the European economic report on female participation in entrepreneurship highlights the gender gap in entrepreneurship in Europe, where men are more likely to start and oversee new businesses than women. The report emphasizes the importance of supporting female entrepreneurship for a more inclusive and sustainable future. Socioeconomic and individual factors, such as government support, cultural approval, obtaining finance, networking, training & education, and fear of failure, influence female entrepreneurial activity in Europe. GEM 2023 reports “there is a significant gender gap in established business ownership, defined as managing a running business for more than 42 months”. Right now, global figures reveal that only 37% of business are owned by women, with a great majority of them from middle- and low-income countries.
Recent data on women's participation in entrepreneurship in Finland indicates that there are still barriers to pursuing entrepreneurship, despite the country's reputation for gender equality. The GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report for Finland highlights lower rates of female participation in entrepreneurship and related activities, suggesting more subtle, cultural barriers that policymakers should address. According to reports, female entrepreneurs in Finland still face gender barriers, including internal and external factors. Internal barriers include self-doubt, fear of failure, and imposter syndrome, while external barriers encompass societal expectations, gender stereotypes, and limited access to funding and networks. The Nordic countries, including Finland, are viewed as forerunners on gender equality and women's labor force participation. However, there are far fewer women than men starting businesses in the Nordics. The study "Female Entrepreneurship in the Nordics 2020" identifies several challenges for women entrepreneurs, such as less access to role models and smaller networks, male-dominated entrepreneurial culture, and limited access to external funding. 
The way forward
As part of concerted efforts to provide a collaborative ecosystem aimed at grooming startups, Tribe Tampere was conceived. It serves the entire Tampere startup ecosystem by uniting startups, talents, and organizations to take action and build a thriving startup community – together! 
What gender diversity and inclusion means for Tribe Tampere.
As part of its charter and very reason for existence “creating a sustainable environment to foster continuous growth, development and expansion of start-ups”, Tribe Tampere is looking to create a balanced atmosphere that fosters growth and success of entrepreneurs and their business alike. This commitment extends to promoting all-round inclusiveness and ensuring equal access to opportunities such as mentorship, finance, and visibility, regardless of gender, race, or color. Thus, breaking all systemic and non-systemic barriers put in place to put individual or group of individuals, ahead of others.
In a nutshell, at Tribe Tampere gender diversity means:
Inclusiveness: Equal opportunities for all gender, race, and color
Idea to innovation: We value and welcome every idea and are ready to provide opportunities and platforms for nurturing them.
Teamwork: we believe in the concept of shared success hence we don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk with you. 
Motivation: The journey won’t be a smooth ride, as your jolly fellow, we are here to support and celebrate you every step of the way
Since its inception in 2017, Tribe Tampere has devised several strategies to grow the startup ecosystem. It has organized events, programs and initiatives not limited to mentorship sessions, community partnerships, fellowships etc. to ensure aspiring entrepreneurs irrespective race, color gender, have equal access to growth, networks, and opportunities. Despite these efforts there seems to be low participation of females in her activities. It is to this end that Tribe Tampere seeks to devise new strategies to solve this problem thus increasing inclusivity and overall female participation in entrepreneurship activities.
Objectives
Below are some of the objectives inline with the strategic goals for 2024
1.	Promoting the diversity of the ecosystem, especially the female participation
2.	Creating a safe space for females within the ecosystem
3.	Increasing the number of female entrepreneurs in Tampere
Specific Objectives
1.	Assess what type of the community events females would want to participate in.
2.	
Strategies
Since the world currently revolves around data, we have identified it as a tool to help us better understand challenges as well as in developing strategies. Hence, we will generate data through the following means.
•	Carrying out a survey, utilizing a well-structured questionnaire for collecting information on participants’ opinions about events.
•	Engage in one-on-one conversation with females during events and outside Tribe’s community.
•	Engage previous female community members, startup founders etc

 
# How to use survey to increase gender diversity at tribe

Introduction

Change is constant, yet bringing about a positive change can be a daunting and challenging experience without information. The process of igniting change or improving a system comes at the cost of adopting systems that help us understand the nature and context of a problem we are trying to solve.  Since the key to solving any problem is availability of information, it is therefore imperative to set up efficient systems for generating accurate data to guide strategic development of plans and effective execution of solutions.

At tribe Tampere, one of our major goals for 2024 is to increase female representation within the entrepreneurship space and the community at large. Current data on gender distribution shows a great disparity between males and female, making the community seem more of a male dominated environment. In a bid to change this narrative, we are faced with the challenge of the nonavailability of data to guide strategy formulation and decision making.

Generating information requires a structured system, and the data gathered can only be as good as the system used to generate it. Surveys have over the years proved to be an effective tool for data gathering, asides from the firsthand information it delivers, the authenticity and validity it provides coupled with its structure make it easy to adopt and utilize for research purposes.

In line with the above, this piece aims to highlight the benefits of survey and how it fits into our strategic plan and help generate the much-needed data required to guide adoption and implementation of viable solutions to the problem at hand.

## Benefits of survey

Below are some of the benefits of survey:

- Cost-Effective
- Anonymity and Comprehensive Data Collection
- Flexible Data Collection Methods and Ease of Administration
- Standardized and Reliable Data
- Increased Response Rates and Candid Responses

## Some disadvantages of surveys

- Limited Depth of Information
- Response Bias
- Survey Design Limitations e.g. (Inability to Probe Responses)
- Potential for Misinterpretation
- Resource Intensive (in the case of paper-based surveys)
- Unwillingness of participating (esp. online)

## Survey Design

- survey design will be straight to point.
- it shall comprise of two parts; one will be targeted at tribe events and the second will address general perception of the community and space.

## Survey Forms

The survey will be administered using two forms:

- Online: participants will scan a QR code which directs them to the link for the survey.
- Paper based: Paper forms of the survey will be printed on paper.

## Survey Administration

- QR code will be printed on paper and placed within visible and easily accessible points within the community space.
- Printed copies of the survey will be placed within accessible points within the community space.

## Strategic use of Survey for data generation?

Data generation can be a daunting task even in the presence of the best of tools. A simple reason for this is basically the dynamic nature of human behavior.  Although humans behave differently, under certain conditions, they exhibit some similarities which can be explored to get the best of them. Below are two strategies we intend to employ to increase participation in the survey.

**Sense of family and ownership**

People often loosen up when they find themselves in safe environments, which is why we don’t want them to feel welcomed as guests but as part of the Tribe family. To achieve this, a sign reading “Welcome Home” (we can think of something better) will be placed in a visible distance for every visitor to see once they step foot into the environment. The goal is to ensure they feel comfortable and relaxed as they would in their home or when visiting a family.  Greeting them with a warm smile will be a representative/existing tribe community member. With our collective effort (ownership), existing members will take it upon themselves to present perks (tea, coffee, chocolate bars etc depending on the visitor’s choice), introduce themselves and the tribe space ensuring all conversations end with a polite ask (Why don’t you fill our first timer survey?).

**Prepare participants (Inform them about the length of the survey).**

Humans naturally dislike suspense, hence participants will be notified of the duration it takes to fill the survey, 2mins max.

NB: Surveys will be made available to visitors whether there is an event or not i.e. irrespective of when an individual visits the space, the survey will be available.

## Conclusion

Surveys are a powerful tool that can provide valuable insights to help address the gender diversity challenge at Tribe Tampere. By leveraging the benefits of surveys - cost-effectiveness, anonymity, flexibility, and standardized data collection - we can gather comprehensive information to guide our strategic efforts in increasing female participation in the community.
